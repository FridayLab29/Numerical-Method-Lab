# MATLAB Numerical Methods 

This repository contains my MATLAB source code from studying numerical methods. The implementations are based on the textbook: **Numerical Methods for Engineers (7th Edition)** 
by Steven C. Chapra and Raymond P. Canale.

This collection does not cover every topic from the book, but it serves as a practical tool for comparing the behavior of different methods. For example, you can explore the differences between the False-Position Method and the Bisection Method, or the Secant Method and the Newton-Raphson Method.


## Methods Included

This repository covers the following numerical methods:

* Roots of Equations
    ** Bracketing Methods **
        * False-Position Method
    ** Open Methods **
        * Secant Method
  
* Linear Algebraic Equations
    ** LU Decomposition **
  
* Numerical Integration
    ** Simpson's Rules **
  
* Optimization
    ** Golden-Section Search **
      
* Ordinary Differential Equations
    ** Runge-Kutta Methods (Fixed step-size) **

## How to Use
Each script is self-contained and can be run directly in MATLAB. 

To solve your own problems, simply:
1.  **Modify the function definition** (e.g., `f = @(x)...` or the matrix `a` and `b`).
2.  **Adjust the initial parameters** (like `xl`, `xu`, `y0`, `h`, etc.) at the top of the file.
3.  Run the script.

## Textbook Reference
**Numerical Methods for Engineers, 7th Edition** by Steven C. Chapra and Raymond P. Canale.

## Please note: 

This code is intended for educational purposes. As it is part of a study project, some implementations may contain errors or are not fully optimized. Always verify the logic and results independently.
